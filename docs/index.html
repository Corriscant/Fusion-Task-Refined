  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 25 November 2025</p>

  <p>
    This privacy policy describes how the mobile application
    <strong>Evolutionary Construct</strong> ("the App") handles user data.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect and process
    device identifiers, approximate location, and usage data to provide and
    improve advertising. Data processing is governed by Google’s own privacy
    policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Data we collect</h2>
  <p>
    The developer does not collect or store personal data on their own
    servers. All data for ads and analytics is processed by third-party
    providers such as Google AdMob.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under the age defined by local law
    for personalized advertising. Where required, only non-personalized ads
    are shown.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
